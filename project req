Algorithms Course Term Project: Performance Analysis of Sorting Algorithms
The aim of this project is to analyze the comparative performance of di6erent sorting
algorithms under various conditions. Students will reinforce their theoretical knowledge
through practical applications while exploring factors that a6ect real-world performance of
algorithms.
Algorithms to be Analyzed in the project are;
1. Quick Sort
2. Heap Sort
3. Shell Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Radix Sort
Analysis Criteria
1. Time Complexity Analysis
- Theoretical analysis (Best, average, and worst case)
- Practical time measurements
- Comparison of theoretical and practical results
2. Memory Usage
- Theoretical memory complexity
- Practical memory usage measurements
- Comparison of in-place and additional memory using algorithms
3. Dataset Characteristics
Test datasets:
- Randomly ordered data
- Partially sorted data
- Reverse ordered data
Data sizes:
- Suggested test sizes:
 - Small (1,000 elements)
 - Medium (10,000 elements)
 - Large (100,000 elements)
- Program should accept data size parameters from GUI
- Di6erent data sizes will be tested during demonstration
